philosophy
of
property
is
complex
it
was
developed
in
a
number

max

egoism
in

argued
that
most
commonly
accepted
social
institutions
including
the
notion
of
state
property
as
a
right
natural
rights
in
general
and
the
very
notion
of
society
were
mere
illusions
or
ghosts
in
the
mind
saying
of
society
that
the
individuals
are
its
reality
he
advocated
egoism
and
a
form
of
amoralism
in
which
individuals
would
unite
in
associations
of
egoists
only
when
it
was
in
their
self
interest
to
do
so
for
him
property
simply
comes
about
through
might
whoever
knows
how
to
take
to
defend
the
thing
to
him
belongs
property
and
what

as

stirner
never
called
himself
an
anarchist
he
accepted
only
the
label
egoist
nevertheless
his
ideas
were
influential
on

inclined
anarchists
