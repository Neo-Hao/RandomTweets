the
english
civil
war
and
are
considered
by
some
as
forerunners
of
modern
anarchism
in
the
modern
era
the
first
to
use
the
term
to
mean
something
other
than
chaos
was
louis
armand
baron
de
lahontan
in
his
nouveaux
voyages
dans
l
am
rique
septentrionale
one
seven
zero
three
where
he
described
the
indigenous
american
society
which
had
no
state
laws
prisons
priests
or
private
property
as
being
in
anarchy
russell
means
a
libertarian
and
leader
in
the
american
indian
movement
has
repeatedly
stated
that
he
is
an
anarchist
and
so
are
all
his
ancestors
in
one
seven
nine
three
in
the
thick
of
the
french
revolution
william
godwin
published
an
enquiry
concerning
political
justice
although
godwin
did
not
use
the
word
anarchism
many
later
anarchists
have
regarded
this
book
as
the
first
major
anarchist
text
and
godwin
as
the
founder
of
philosophical
anarchism
but
at
this
point
no
anarchist
movement
yet
existed
and
the
term
anarchiste
was
known
mainly
as
an
insult
hurled
by
the
bourgeois
girondins
at
more
radical
elements
in
the
french
revolution
the
first
self
labelled
anarchist
pierre
joseph
proudhon
it
is
commonly
held
that
it
wasn
t
until
pierre
joseph
proudhon
published
what
is
property
in
one
eight
four
zero
that
the
term
anarchist
was
adopted
as
a
self
description
it
is
for
this
reason
that
some
claim
proudhon
as
the
founder
of
modern
anarchist
theory
in
what
is
property
proudhon
answers
with
the
famous
accusation
property
is
theft
in
this
work
he
opposed
the
institution
of
decreed
property
propri
t
where
owners
have
complete
rights
to
use
and
abuse
their
property
as
they
wish
such
as
exploiting
workers
for
profit
in
its
place
proudhon
supported
what
he
called
possession
individuals
can
have
limited
rights
to
use
resources
capital
and
goods
in
accordance
with
principles
of
equality
and
justice
proudhon
s
vision
of
anarchy
which
he
called
mutualism
mutuellisme
involved
an
exchange
economy
where
individuals
and
groups
could
trade
the
products
of
their
labor
using
labor
notes
which
represented
the
amount
of
working
time
involved
in
production
this
would
ensure
that
no
one
would
profit
from
the
labor
of
others
workers
could
freely
join
together
in
co
operative
workshops
an
interest
free
bank
would
be
set
up
to
provide
everyone
with
access
to
the
means
of
production
proudhon
s
ideas
were
influential
within
french
working
class
movements
and
his
followers
were
active
in
the
revolution
