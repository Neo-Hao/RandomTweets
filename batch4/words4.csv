became

from

start
karl
marx
was
a
leading
figure
in
the
international
he
was
elected
to
every
succeeding
general
council
of
the

the
first
objections
to
marx
came
from
the
mutualists
who
opposed
communism
and
statism
shortly
after
mikhail

joined

eight
the
first
international
became
polarised
into
two
camps
with
marx
and
bakunin
as
their
respective
figureheads
the
clearest
difference
between
the
camps
was
over
strategy
the
anarchists
around
bakunin
favoured
in
kropotkin
s
words
direct
economical
struggle
against
capitalism
without
interfering
in
the
political
parliamentary
agitation
at
that
time
marx
and
his
followers
focused
on
parliamentary
activity
bakunin
characterised
marx
s
ideas
as
authoritarian
and
predicted
that
if
a
marxist
party
gained
to
power
its
leaders
would
end
up
as
bad
as
the
ruling
class

the
conflict
climaxed
with
a
final
split
between
the
two
groups
at
the
hague
congress
this
is
often
cited
as
the
origin
of
the
conflict
between
anarchists
and
marxists
from
this
moment
the
social
democratic
and
libertarian
currents
of
socialism
had
distinct
organisations
including

anarchist
communism
peter
kropotkin
proudhon
and

both
opposed
communism
associating
it
with
statism
however
in

zero
s
many
anarchists
moved
away
from
bakunin
s
economic
thinking
called
collectivism
and
embraced
